# Practices for Sharing Client Data

To insure the security of [moderately sensitive client data](http://security.virginia.edu/university-data-protection-standards), lab members agree to the following practices and terms.

1. The data will be available for a short time on a shared UVA Box folder, [approved for moderately sensitive data](http://its.virginia.edu/box/responsibilities.html). Lab members should download the file to a temporary location on your hard drive when available.
2. Lab members should put the data file in an encrypted volume with password protection on their computers.
  * A common option for Mac, PC, or Linux is the free, open-source encryption software [VeraCrypt](https://www.veracrypt.fr/en/Home.html). Here are instructions for [installing and using VeraCrypt on a PC](https://securityinabox.org/en/guide/veracrypt/windows/); here's another set of [instructions for PC](https://www.howtogeek.com/108501/the-how-to-geek-guide-to-getting-started-with-truecrypt/). Here are [instructions for a Mac](https://securityinabox.org/en/guide/veracrypt/mac/); for use on a Mac, you must also install OSXFUSE. Create a standard volume; this is where we'll store the data.
  * Once the data is in a protected volume or folder, delete the data file from the temporary location. You'll view or call the data from, or save to, the protected folder only. You will need to mount the folder/volume each time you want to use the data, and dismount the folder/volume when you're done working.
3. Lab members should not place copies of the data file in any other location, including on portable storage devices or public machines.
4. Lab members should not print the data file.
5. When working with the data in non-private spaces, lab members should not leave their computers unattended. 
6. Lab members should not show or share the data file with colleagues outside the lab. If seeking help with code or analysis from those outside the lab, do not display the data frame in the data viewer.
7. At the conclusion of the semester project, when we have submitted the report, lab members should delete the data from their computers entirely.

Relatedly, while we will share code and the reasons and choices that go into generating the analysis, we will communicate the *results* of our work to our client. Our client is responsible for disseminating and communicating the results outward.
